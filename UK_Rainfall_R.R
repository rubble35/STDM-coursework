## 1 IMPORT THE DATA

# 1.1 Monthly UK Rainfall Data by Region

# Dataset being used is monthly rainfall records for the UK sourced from the UK Met Office.
# This data was recently updated as a result of the crowdsourcing project 'Rainfall Rescue'.
# The period covered is January 1836 to December 2021.

## THIS IS A LARGE DATASET THAT TAKES SOME TIME TO LOAD ##

# 1.2 Monthly UK Rainfall Records for Historic UK Weather Stations

# This dataset comprises historic monthly rainfall records for 37 individual weather stations across the UK sourced from the UK Met Office.

# Data goes back to 1855 for some stations, but most stations have full records going back only to 1960's.
# Data imported for analysis is monthly for the period Sep 1964 to Aug 2016 (624 months), but just for 29 stations that have a full record in this timeframe.

# These maps clearly show that (for this single year) the western and northern regions of the UK are the wettest, although N.Ireland is relatively drier than nearby W Scotland
# The driest regions are towards the east and the south
# This is in line with expectations based on knowledge of the south-westerly prevailing weather pattern in the UK, which brings rain in from the Atlantic and the central hills and mountains of England and Scotland create a rain shadow effect to the east
# Looking just at 1984, there is an indication of seasonality with more rain in the autumn/winter than spring/summer.
# Needs investigating further to see if this is a pattern that bears out across more/all years in the study.

## 3 STATISTICAL MODELLING OF TIME SERIES AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL SERIES

# 3.1 Time Series Decomposition

# Use STL to decompose the Scotland N data
# Choosing this dataset as it showed the highest levels of temporal autocorrelation
# First, separate the Scotland N data from the rest of the UK rain data and convert to a time-series
Scot_N_ts <- ts(rain_matrix[1,], frequency = 12, start=c(1836,1))

# Then run stl function (t.window parameter should be odd or NULL)
decom <- stl(Scot_N_ts, t.window=NULL, s.window="periodic")
autoplot(decom)
# Hard to see due to length of timeseries

# Try on shorter timeseries (1990-2021)
Scot_N_sts <- ts(rain_matrix[1,1849:2232], frequency = 12, start=c(1990,1))
decom <- stl(Scot_N_sts, t.window=25, s.window="periodic")
autoplot(decom)
# Various different values of t.window used to extract a trend. Settled for t.window=25 as remainders smaller
# Trend component not clear - may not need nonseasonal differencing; may only need to use seasonal differencing
# Clear seasonality extracted through the stl decomposition process, although seasonal component only ranges +/-60mm
# Remainders still significant in size, typically ranging +/-100mm - larger than the seasonal component (which is actually smaller than the trend component based on the bars to the side of the plots)


# 3.2 ARIMA

# Use the Box-Jenkins approach to ARIMA modelling

# 3.2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

# Have already performed this above
# UK Regional rainfall data shows seasonality as it is presented as monthly, with no clear trend up or down over time
# Annual average rainfall for UK Weather Stations does not show seasonality as it is annual, but no clear trend up or down over time: it appears stationary

# Lag plot for Scotland N region
lag.plot(rain_matrix[1,], lags=12, do.lines=FALSE)
# No clear patterns identified, which is a bit surprising considering seasonality already identified

# 3.2.2 Differencing, AutoCorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Factors

# Examine the Scotland N time series and associated ACF and PACF
# ggtsdisplay function sourced from Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 2nd Ed. otexts.com/fpp2/
ggtsdisplay(Scot_N_sts, main="Scotland N timeseries 1990 to 2021")
# ACF shows strong seasonal pattern with positive peaks at lags 0 (as per default), 12, 24, 36, 48 and negative peaks at lags 6, 18, 30, 42
# Suggests seasonal differencing is required with an order of 12, which makes sense as this is monthly data

# Seasonal differencing
# Perform first seasonal differencing at lag 12, plot the differenced data and re-run the ACF and PACF
SN_s_diff <- diff(Scot_N_sts, lag=12)
ggtsdisplay(SN_s_diff, main="Scotland N Seasonally Differenced")
# Seasonal differencing has pretty much removed the seasonal pattern after lag 12
# Fits description of "one or more spikes, rest essentially zero", which implies MA model
# Significant autocorrelation remains at lags 1 and 12 (seasonal lag 1), which suggests Q=1 and potentially q=1
# Significant PACF values seen at lag 1 and seasonal lags 1, 2, 3 - potentially suggests p=1?

# Try non-seasonal differencing and re-run ACF and PACF
SN_ns_diff <- diff(Scot_N_sts)
ggtsdisplay(SN_ns_diff, main="Scotland N Non-Seasonally Differenced")
# ACF shows significant -ve ACF at lag 1, 6, 18 and +ve ACF at lags 12, 24, which suggests seasonal pattern remains
# This suggests non-seasonal differencing alone does not lead to stationarity
# PACF shows significant -ve PACF at lag 1, which slowly decays to insignificant values, indicative of an MA model (q=1)

# Try seasonal and nonseasonal differencing together
